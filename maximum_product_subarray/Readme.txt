initialize a variable 'c' with and keep multiplying elements from the start of array and calculate maximum of it.
The variable 'c' is reinitialised to 1 when product become 0.
We repeat the above operation from the back of the array as well.
This algorith is also famously called Kadane's algorithm.
Time complexity - O(n).
Sapce Complexity - O(1)
